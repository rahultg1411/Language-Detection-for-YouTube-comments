Only thing its NOT Aryan Invasion rather it is just Aryan migration.\\n\\nAryans are called as Devas\\nDravidian\\'s are called Asuras\\n\\nAryan Gods – Lord Indra, Lord Varuna, Lord Vayu, Lord Brahma & Lord Ram\\nDravidian Gods – Shiva, Visnu, Krishna & Karthikeya\\n\\nIn Four Vedas there is NO Mention about Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu [Thiru Maal] & Lord Subramanian [Murugan]. In Vedas they only worship Lord Indra, Lord Varuna & Lord Vayu. In Rig Veda they mention about Lord Rudra but he is NOT Lord Shiva. There is NO Place where they mentioned about Lord Shiva or Linga. These are all Tamil gods Lord Shiva, Lord Thiru maal [Vishnu] & Lord Murugan [Subramanian] are all ancient Tamils lived in Tamil Land. \\n\\nAryan by Birth – Ram, Lakshman\\nDravidian by Birth – Ravan, Shiva,  Visnu, Krishna & Karthikeya\\n\\nAryan Language – Sanskrit\\nDravidian Language – Tamil\\n\\nAryan [Sankrit] Grammar - Panini’s Astadhyayi\\nDravidan [Tamil] Grammar – Tholkaappiyam [Still available] \\n\\nPanini did not mention the name of even a single earlier Sanskrit grammar which he has followed. The names he mentioned as earlier Sanskrit grammarians are originally Prakrit and Pali grammarians. Prakrit and Pali grammarians have followed Aindhra grammar which is followed by Tholkaappiyar. Tholkapiyar clearly states that there are numerous Tamil Grammar works prior to his Tholkappiyam and he followed Aindharam Grammar for his work. Akathiyar also wrote a grammar for Tamil. Tharanath ,the Tibet scholar has clearly stated that Aindhiram was a Tamil grammar. Sari Buddha had studied Aindhiram.\\n\\nAryan by Birth – Bramins\\nDravidian by Birth – Sudras [Tamils - please note Tamils lived through out India]\\n\\nEtymology of the word Bramin [பேர்  அமணன் -> பிராமணன் -> பிராமின் ] Payrr Ammanan –> Brahmanan –> Bramin. Its a Pure Tamil word given as Title to people who gained enormous wisdom in their life. In later days this title name was stolen by Aryan Bramins and made it as a varna by Birth.\\n\\nSanghis will tell that Ravana was a Bramin, Ravana is Asura [Dravidian] by birth and Bramin is his title name. He is a master of 10 different science \\n\\nEtymology for the name Krishna [ கருதினன் -> கிருத்தினன் -> கிருஷ்ணா ] Karuthinan → Kirutinan → Krishna . Karuthinan means man of philosophy its a Title given to Krishna \\n\\nWe all know that Krishna is Dark in Complexion and he is a Cow herder he is a Tamil.\\n\\nRig Veda has several references to blonde haired Indra destroying Dark skinned Asuras [Dravidian\\'s]. If you read most of the Sanskrit puranas you can notice that its all about Fight between Aryans and Dravidians [Devas and Asuras] \\n\\nLanguage naturally evolves over 1000s of years it can NOT be invented by one single guy Agathiyar, Tamil language is NOT invented by Agathiyar as told by PERVERTED Sanskrit Myth, one has to Talk with scientific facts should NOT vomit PERVERTED Sanskrit Myths. Just like Tholkappiyar Agathiyar also wrote grammar for Tamil in ancient times thats it.\\n\\nTamil is older then Sanskrit. Its actually Tamil root words which are there in Sanskrit, NOT the other way around. Recent [year 2020] excavation in Keezadi have written Tamil inscription which is older than 2500 years. But on the other hand  Sanskrit didn\\'t even had a script to write until 4 CE note it is CE not BCE, it adopted devanagari script in 4 CE and started writing puranas like Ramayana ... etc. Prior to this Sanskrit Vedas were transferred to next generation only orally, they said it is very sacred and only Brahmins have to recite it\\n\\nGoogle - Mayiladumparai Excavation in Tamil Nadu - Tamils knew use of iron 4,000 years ago, archaeological findings show\\n\\nGoogle - Porunai civilisation is 3,200 years old\\n\\nTamils do not have Vedic culture roots, their roots are different.  Vedic culture is a third rated culture. Sanskrit is full  of third rated SEXUALLY PERVERTED mythological stories for Lord Shiva, Indra, Ayyappa and for lots of Rishis. You can not find one such sexually perverted literature in Tamil.  Sanskrit is full of Racial Abuse and Racial discrimination based on birth like Manusimriti. You wont find any such discrimination in Tamil literature\\n\\nThiruvalluvar in Thiru Kural says all Living Things are equal [Not just humans]  (பிறப்பொக்கும் எல்லா உயிர்க்கும் சிறப்பொவ்வா செய்தொழில் வேற்றுமை யான் - திருக்குறள் 972). But in Sanskrit Manusmriti,  manu discriminate people based on birth called Varna, Manusimriti is full of Racial Abuse and Racial discrimination based on birth.\\n\\nTamils have the culture of worshiping there fore fathers that is how they are worshiping Siva, Thiru Maal [Vishnu] & Murugan [Subramanian]. Aryan Brahmins stolen Tamil\\'s gods and and inserted FULLY SEXUALLY PERVERTED STORIES in later days for our gods like Vishnu Purana, Shiva Purana, Skanda Purana ... etc  Now some idiots are even saying Lord Shiva don\\'t understand Tamil and so we have to worship him only in Sanskrit. Lord Siva himself is a Tamil \\n\\nTamil too have Sanskrit words its due to Sanskrit became sole authority for Hinduism and for Tamil Gods also. By stealing Tamils gods Sanskrit started influencing Tamil by way Varnasrama by saying Brahmins are great and they are born from Brahmas head. You have to respect Brahmin and you have to allow them to worship your gods in their language Sanskrit.\\n\\nGoogle - Tamil and Australian aboriginal languages\\n\\nமார் சுபிகள்  Marsupial is a A word found in Australian Aboriginals language for Kangaroo kids. Marsupial in Tamil means Breast Suckers,  Small Kangaroo kids will grow inside Mother Kangaroos waist bag by sucking milk from its mothers breast. English language derived this word from Australian Aborginals language, This word is more than 10,000 years old it\\'s a pure Tamil word. \\n\\nArchaeological experts all over the world says that Indus valley civilization is a Dravidian civilization, but here in India Sanghis says its a vedic civilization but they do NOT Have any proof for their claim.\\n\\nIndus script - Wikipedia\\n\\nThe Russian scholar Yuri Knorozov suggested, based on computer analysis, a Dravidian language as the most likely candidate for the underlying language of the script.[40] Knorozov\\'s suggestion was preceded by the work of Henry Heras, who also suggested several readings of signs based on a proto-Dravidian assumption. [41]\\n\\nOldest available work in Sanskrit [Note it is only oral No written records] is Rig veda, it has been etymologically proved that there are many loaned Tamil words in Rig veda that proves the pre existence of Tamil during the period of Rig veda\\n\\nSubstrata in the Vedic language - Wikipedia\\n\\nThere are an estimated thirty to forty Dravidian loanwords in Vedic. [26] Those for which Dravidian etymologies are proposed by Zvelebil include कुलाय kulāya \"nest\", कुल्फ kulpha \"ankle\", दण्ड daṇḍa \"stick\", कूल kūla \"slope\", बिल bila \"hollow\", खल khala \"threshing floor\".

ہوئی ہے۔جہاں ملک کی آبادی لگاتار بڑھ رہی ہے اور تمام بڑی زبانوں کے بولنے والوں کی تعداد میں اضافہ ہو اہے،اردو  کے اعداد و شمار ایک الگ ہی داستان بیان کر رہے ہیں۔پہلی بات یہ کہ نہ صرف اردو کو اپنی مادری زبان درج کرانے والوں کے  فیصد میں کمی آئی ہے، بلکہ تعدادمیں بھی قابل لحاظ کمی ہوئی ہے۔ آزادی کے بعد ہر دہائی میں اردو بولنے والوں کی تعداد بدتریج بڑھتی رہی ہے۔\\n1971 کی مردم شماری رپورٹ میں یہ تعداد2 کروڑ 86 لاکھ تھی، جو دس سال بعد 1981 میں ساڑھے 3 کروڑ ہو گئی تھی۔ اس کے بعد1991 میں یہ 4 کروڑ 40 لاکھ تک پہنچ گئی۔ اس صدی کی پہلی مردم شماری یعنی 2001 میں یہ 5 کروڑ 15 لاکھ سے تجاوز کر گئی تھی۔مگر2011 کی مردم شماری، جس کی رپورٹس کافی بعد میں آیئں، اور جس میں زبانوں کے اعداد و شمار کے تجزیہ کی رپورٹ اب جاری کی گئی ہے، یہ تعداد بڑھی نہیں بلکہ کم ہوئی ہے۔ یعنی اب اردو ہندوستان میں سرکاری اعداد و شمار کی حیثیت سے ساڑھے چار فیصد سے بھی کم لوگوں کی زبان ہے۔\\nآپ لاکھ کہیں کہ اردو بولنے والوں کی تعداد اس سے گئی گنا زیادہ ہے مگر اعداد و شمار کے حساب سے اردو کا کمزور ہونا، زبان کے لیے نیک فال نہیں ہے۔کچھ لوگوں کورپورٹس پر شک  ہونے لگتا ہےااور  اس  کمی کے پیچھے بھی سازش نظر آتی ہے مگر حقیقت تلخ ہے۔یہ سچ ہے کہ زبان کسی مذہب کی نہیں ہوتی مگر یہ بھی ایک سچائی ہے کہ ہندوستان میں عام طور پرمسلمان  ہی اردو کو اپنی مادری زبان کے طور پر درج کرواتا ہے۔اور گزشتہ کچھ دہائیوں کی مردم شماری  سے ظاہر ہو رہا تھا کہ حالات بگڑنا شروع ہو گئے ہیں۔\\nاتر پردیش کو اردو کا ہوم لینڈ تصور کیا جاتا ہے۔ یہاں تقریباً پونے 4 کروڑ مسلمان رہتے ہیں مگر بمشکل 1 کروڑ 8 لاکھ نے اردو کو مادری زبان درج کروایا۔یہ ٹرینڈ آج سے بیس پچیس سال پہلے شروع ہو گیا تھا، تب مسلمانوں کی آبادی اور اردو آبادی کا تناسب50فیصدی تھا، جو بگڑتے بگڑتے28 فیصد ی پر آ گیا ہے۔ یعنی یہاں 100 میں سے صرف 28 مسلمان اردو کو مادری زبان درج کروا رہے ہیں۔ظاہر ہے، وہ نسلیں جن کو اردو سے جذباتی لگاؤ تھا، ختم ہو رہی ہیں۔ یہی حال راجستھان، مدھیہ پردیش اورشمال کے دوسرے صوبوں کا ہے ۔یہ وہ صوبے ہیں جہاں مسلمان عام طور پر اردو کو اپنی زبان سمجھتا تھا –بہار کی صورتحال اتر پردیش سے بہتر ہے مگر وہاں بھی حالات تسلی بخش نہیں ہے-وہاں مسلم آبادی پونے 2 کروڑ ہے اور اردو گو آبادی ساڑھے 87 لاکھ۔\\nجنوبی ہنداورمہاراشٹر کی صورت حال بالکل مختلف ہے۔ یہاں مسلم آبادی اور اردو گو آبادی میں بہت کم فرق ہے۔ تلنگانہ-آندھرا پردیش میں 81 لاکھ مسلمان ہیں اور اردو بولنے والے 75لاکھ—یعنی 90 فیصد مسلمان اردو کواپنی مادری زبان لکھوا رہے ہیں، جبکہ شمال کے صوبوں میں یہ تعدادتیس اور بیس فیصد سے بھی کم ہے۔کرناٹک بھی ایسا ہی صوبہ ہے جہاں اردو بے حد مضبوط نظر آتی ہے۔حد تویہ ہے کہ تمل ناڈو میں بھی اردو بولنے والوں کی تعدادراجستھان اور مدھیہ پردیش کے مقابلہ زیادہ ہے۔گجرات، آسام اور بنگال میں مسلمان کی زبان عام طور پر گجراتی، بنگلہ اور آسامی رہی  ہے مگر شمال کی ان ریاستوں میں تو مسلم معاشرہ میں اردو کا ہی رواج تھا۔\\nہم  د ل بہلانے کے لیےیہ  کہہ سکتے ہیں کہ  اردو جاننا اور اردو کو اپنی زبان لکھوانے میں فرق ہے۔ مگر یہ حقیقت ہے کہ شمال میں ایک بڑی اردو گو آبادی ایسی ہے  جو اردو اور ہندی میں کوئی خاص فرق نہیں سمجھتی اور یہ اعداد و شمار اسی رجحان کا مظہر ہیں۔ہندی ملک کی سب سے بڑی اور سرکاری زبان ہے۔ ہندی اور اردو دونوں کی بقا  ضروری ہے۔ہندی بولنے والوں کے تعداد میں دس سال میں 10کروڑ کا حیرت انگیز اضافہ ہوا ہے۔ 42 کروڑ سے بڑھ کر یہ تعداد اب 52 کروڑ تک پہنچ گئی ہے۔آٹھویں شیڈیول میں شامل 22 زبانوں میں صرف اردو اور کونکنی کے بولنے والے کم ہوئے ہیں۔\\nرپورٹس میں صاف نظر آتا ہے کہ شمالی ہندوستان میں اردو سے جذباتی وابستگی کم ہوتی جا رہی ہے اورمردم شماری کے وقت  لوگ اس بات پر غالباً ر توجہ نہیں دیتے کہ مادری زبان کے خانے میں اردو ہی لکھوانا ہے۔شمال کے کچھ صوبوں اور اضلاع میں تو یہ حال ہے کہ اگر لوگ ابھی نہ جاگے توان ٹرینڈس کے حساب سے آگے چل کر  اتنے کم بولنے والے رہ جائیں گے کہ وہاں  اردو  کی حیثیت ایک بولی جیسی ہو جائے گی۔ اردو اب ساتویں نمبر پر کھسک گئی ہے اور گجراتی بولنے والوں کی تعداد بھی اس سے زیادہ ہو گئی ہے۔\\nپھر بھی اگر 5 کروڑ  سے کچھ زیادہ لوگ اردو کو اپنی زبان لکھواتے ہیں تو اس کے لیے جنوبی ہندوستان کے اردو معاشرے کا سب سے اہم کردار ہے۔ جن صوبوں میں ہندی ریاستی زبان نہیں ہے، وہاں اردو ابھی بھی مسلم شناخت سے جڑی ہوئی ہے۔اس کا یہ مطلب نہیں ہے کہ ہم پھر سے زبان کامرثیہ لکھنا شروع کر دیں اور ‘اردو مر رہی ہے’،  جیسےجملوں کی گردان شروع کر دیں۔بہر حال مہاراشٹر، دکن  اور جنوبی ہندوستان کے اردو  بولنے والے اس بات پر بجا فخر کر سکتے ہیں کہ انہوں نے ہی اس زبان سے محبت کا حق ادا کیا ہے۔ بے شک اورنگ آباد سے گلبرگہ  اور حیدرآباد سے ویلور تک کا علاقہ اردو کا مستقر بن گیا ہے۔جنوب کے اردو والے کہہ  سکتے ہیں کہ ان کو اردو کے تیئں محبت کے ثبوت  دینے کی ضرورت نہیں ہے۔وہ اس کا عملی ثبوت پیش کر چکے ہیں۔\\nصدیوں سے یہ اردو کا علاقہ رہا ہے اور آج بھی یہ اردو کا مضبوط قلعہ ہے۔ شمال، خصوصاً اتر پردیش، جو آبادی کے لحاظ سے ہندوستان کا اور اردو بولنے والوں کا بھی سب سے بڑا صوبہ ہے، وہاں اردو داں طبقہ کو اس سے سیکھ لینے کی ضرورت ہے۔', 'Ugw5wj7QQVKGv43_tKp4AaABAg': 'Queen of all languages kanada', 'UgynyeuLCLTt5PtrxxJ4AaABAg': 'I am North Indian .I live in Haryana I know haryanavi , punjabi,Hindi,Gujarati,Marathi,

If one notices ,the tool of ‘comparative linguistics’used to prove the PiE theory was specifically made to just prove  the PIE theory.The results came before the exam.Hence the  Indo Aryan’ origin of Sanskrit.There are obvious similarities between Indian and European languages,but the direction of flow is assumed…and nobody really has questioned it till now.Historically these similarities should not be surprising,as the subcontinent,esp. the north has always been in contact with the world through trade for millenia,way before  when  (1500 bc) they were suppposed to have been introduced to India.That’s why the oldest written mention of Sanskrit is on a royal tablet (1400bc)in Syria(trading route) but not in Sanskrit itself.Its in the local Hittite language with few Sanskrit words).If Sanskrit actually came from there wouldn’t the entire document be in Sanskrit?Also the similarities between North Indian and European languages is overplayed and between north and South Indian languages(and its literature) is often downplayed. It’s about how the narrative is built.Another thing that does not add up….the depth and sheer volume of material we have in Vedic Sanskrit,it’s change into Prakrit languages and then it’s reorganizing into classical Sanskrit and  the formation of colloquial languages and dialects that we use today is way too much and unnecessary for a1000 yr evolutionary period.A fact that is usually ignored.Vedic Sanskrit literature in turn is distinctly Indian,it’s descriptions of geography and people .It’s been a while since the linguistic proponents of the AIT have been trying to fit a square peg into a round hole,trying prove an foreign origin of Sanskrit in keeping with AIT,but other than comparative linguistics which is not objective, there is absolutely no scientific  evidence to corroborate this.Now if the AIT/PIE theory is taken away,the Indus-Saraswati civilization is not artificially made alien and distinct from Vedic culture ,things start falling into place beautifully.Not just with languages like Sanskrit and Tamil that have caught people’s fancy,but with other Indian languages and dialects as well that have been largely ignored.', 'Ugzy4x659PpWmErwaGV4AaABAg': \"My mother tongue is konkani especially GSBrahmin konkani.\\nI Can communicate in Roman catholic konkani too.\\nI can speak very well in Tulu because it is our regional Tulunadu language. \\n\\nI m little more good at kannada because I got educated in kannada medium school & it is our state language. \\n\\nI can speak Hindi but not very good at conversation.\\nI studied Hindi at school as a third language. \\nHindi is more near to Hindi & marati.

M.S. Andronov, the Russian Linguist, states that 'Tulu has emerged as an independent language from the Proto-Dravidian family, 2000 years back.' (M.S.Andronov: Dravidian Languages, 1970.) Robert Caldwell, another Linguist had clearly stated, 'Tulu is one of the most highly developed languages of Dravidian family of languages and has an equal place among the languages like Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and Kannada'. (Robert Caldwell, Comparative Grammar of Dravidian Languages, 1856.) Dr. P.S. Subrahmanyam, Professor of Linguistics, Annamalai University, Tamilnadu has shown Tulu as the first offshoot of Proto-South Dravidian Language Family, about 2800 years back (Position of Tulu in Dravidian, Indian Linguistics; 1968).\\n\\n2. On the basis of excavations, the archaeologists observed that Tulu speaking area was inhabited by the people of old stone age (about 25000 B.C.). The tools of old stone age were also discovered in this region. The axes of new stone age (of 12000 B.C.) were also discovered in this region. Similarly copper age, bronze age and iron age tools were also discovered.\\n\\n3. Tulu speaking people were mentioned in Tamil Sangam Literature of 2nd century A.D. A Greek drama of 2nd century A.D. also records some Tulu words spoken at that time in coastal Karnataka. The language, Tulu is spoken by people belonging to different religions, castes and tribes. Hindus, Jains, Muslims and Christians use Tulu language in their communication in west coast region of Karnataka. This language is considered as a binding force and also a symbol of communal harmony by different religious groups and sects in Karnataka.\\n\\n4. Tulu has its own independent script. The first manuscript in Tulu script is 'Tulu Mahabharata' of 14th century AD. Tulu classical epics in Tulu script like Tulu Bhagavata, Kaveri, Devi Mahatme were written in 16th and 17th centuries. There are thousands of palm leaf manuscripts written in Tulu script which are preserved in archives, in universities and research institutions in Karnataka.\\n\\n5. Tulu has a rich heritage of oral traditions. Different genres of Tulu folklore, namely , oral epics, prose narratives, proverbs, riddles, customs and rituals, performances, festivals, theatres and such other forms exist since thousands of years. This rich oral tradition of Tulu culture has been documented and studied by scholars from various countries like USA, Finland, Germany, France, Japan, UK, and Italy. Linguists and folklorists from various countries had conducted research projects on Tulu folklore.\\n\\n6. Tulu language and culture have been included in academic programmes in universities and research institutions within India and abroad.

Publication of Tulu books started in 1830 by German missionaries in Karnataka. They were instrumental in bringing out standard reference books for Tulu like grammar, dictionary, text books, translations, compilation of folklore. More than 500 Tulu books were published during 1830-1930. Tulu is recognized as having a modern scientific lexicon which is somewhat rare for a language like Tulu.\\n\\n9. Tulu-Kannada-English Lexicon (Vol. 1-6 Chief Editor Dr. U.P.Upadhyaya, 1988-1997) has got international recognition as an unique work incorporating different dimensions of a language like classical literature, modern literature, spoken dialect and folklore.\\n\\n10. From 20th century onwards, Tulu has been used as a medium for writings both in creative and research fields. For the last hundred years, about two thousand Tulu books have been published in various areas like literature, history, linguistics, folklore, translation, culture, art and architecture. Tulu literature has to its credit all major genres of modern literature like poetry, epic, short story, novel, drama, criticism and prose.\\n\\n11.

Tulu magazines have been published from 1970 onwards. Even Kannada news papers devote columns for Tulu writings.\\n\\n15. The Government of Karnataka has established Tulu Sahitya Academy in 1994. The Tulu Academy has been instrumental for the development of Tulu language and literature in modern times. The Government of Kerala has also established a Tulu academy in 2007. This is a rare example of two neighboring states, Karnataka and Kerala, establishing academies for the development of Tulu.\\n\\n16. Central Sahitya Academy. New Delhi has shown a rare gesture, in recognizing Tulu in the form of instituting Bhasha Samman award. Two eminent Tulu writers Mandara Keshava Bhat and Kedambadi Jattappa Rai, have been honored with Bhasha samman by Sahitya Academy New Delhi in 1996.\\n\\n17. Tulu is very rich in traditional folk theatre, like Yakshagana. More than 40 troupes of Yakshagana perform throughout the year in different places and cater to the needs of lakhs of people with rich heritage of Tulu language and culture.

It serves no purpose. The fact that Indians learn English as part of their standard education, including far flung (rich) east Asian countries like China, South Korea, and Japan, and even most of Europe, means you are set for life and will have it easier than others.

Voiced/unvoiced are based on whether the stops are word-initial or doubled. nasals and stops pair up to give natural sounds. Tamil doesnt differentiate aspiration. E.G the word \"Sakthi\" is illegal in tamil since k cannot precede th.

I often find some assamese and  bengalis making this mistake using the word while speaking hindi. I have put forward these statements solely on my empirical listening experiences and a funny personal incident. \\n\\nGrowing up in a small town probably with an urban area of just 9 sq.km and population of 45,000. I’d still say my hometown kokrajhar, btr, assam is a ‘boiling pot of languages’. The place where the languages of the east meets the languages of the west. It is the headquarter of the western-most district of assam with the same name geographically, the gateway district to northeast india bordering bhutan to the north,  west bengal to the west, dhubri district to the south and chirang district to the east. So much so that the announcements in kokrajhar railway station are announced in 5 languages- bodo, assamese, bengali, hindi and english all of which I can speak, interchangeably. However,  there is a sense of intermingling of words  into every other language among the people of different ethno-linguistic groups where only few speak the standard version of their own 1st language or mother-tongue. Hence, there is also a prevailing locally humourously so-called \\'labra\\' language(literally mix-vegetable language) that can be heard in the street and the market.\\n\\nThe funny incident that happened with me was when i initially started living and studying in delhi back in 2012. While i was travelling in an autorickshaw, i gave direction to the autowalla with a landmark and said uske ‘aage’ huh, bhaiya?!(thinking before that place huh,bhaiya?! ; thinking beni sigang in bodo=taar agot in assamese=taar aage in bengali=uske aage in hindi) for my destination and told him to stop when I reached. He was surprised and asked me \"lekin aapne toh Bola tha ki uske ‘aage’ Jane he\"? i replied haanji bhaiya. Uske aage bola lekin uske aage jana he toh  nahi bola na and only then realized uske \\'pehele\\' bolna chahiye tha. He smiled and went away after charging me the same amount he had asked me for the distance he thought i was going to. Fortunately, it was\\'nt a hit to my pocket because the distance he had thought of I was going to was not so much to my destination, maybe a km or so.\\n\\nTill today, interestingly, I am not sure if it was either my poor hindi or me being pseudo-multilingual  had put me into that situation in the first place. Moreover, \\'Aage\\' in hindi and bengali and \\'Agot\\' in assamese meaning almost the same also sounds similar as both assamese and hindi belongs to same Indo-European branch of languages whereas my mother tongue, bodo belongs to Sino-Tibetan branch of languages. \\n \\nNow, I must indeed say that intertwining of words of different languages can lead not just to misunderstandings but can also rather prove to be deadly in a way. I suggest  the word should be used wisely by the speaker before the listener grabs the person before grabbing the context.  Here are some phrases and clauses that makes the difference between the languages - \\n\\n1.

Robert Caldwell learned so called wrongly named \"dravidian languages\" in the motive to translate bible and spread christianity. And it was common that some person knew 5 languages or more from different parts of the world for the reason of trade and others. So, he was no linguist. Tamil is the mother of Dravidian languages. The other languages are created due to mix of sanskrit with pure Tamil. I worked in Karnataka where Kannada is spoken, which gave me a chance to learn to speak and read Kannada. Malayalam is very closely related to Tamil. One of major differences between Tamil and Malayalam is that Malayalam uses verbs same as Tamil but leaving the endings of the verbs (conjugations related to person, but it holds the information of tense). Caldwell\\'s usage of the word \"dravidian\" is completely out of context and the word \"dravidian\" is foreign to the whole culture of the languages that are cateorised under that name. The appropriate word is \"Tamil Group\" of languages. Speaking about Tamil, it is self developed language. Also the culture is unique. The culture and language of Tamils were self developed by the people who belong to such ethnicities over 20,000 years.

Pali has been classified variously by scholars - western language, lingua franca with features from east and west (Geiger), Koine Gangétique (Helmer Smith), Dichtersprache (trans-regional poetic language) (Bechert).  It has been shown that Paali cannot be same or descendant from Magadhi. \\n\\nSinhala is most certainly not from Maharashtri prakrit. Nobody knows the exact region Sinhala originates from. Wilhelm Geiger meant that it is a western dialect as it retains some western features, like the retention of initial v- while in eastern dialects the v- becomes b-.  Sinhala also has some eastern features. Most linguists agree that Sinhala parted from India long before the majour changes in the Prakrits occurred. Scholars have been arguing for ever now whether it has an eastern or western origin. It could very well be that Sinhala left India before the Eastern and Western dialects split. There is another school of thought that claims that Sinhala is from an entirely different branch of the Indo-European family than Sanskrit  and the Indian languages, as the retention of \"Vatura\" for Water which is not present in Sanskrit, also the proto Indo-European word for wheel has been said to originate from a reduplication of the verb *kwel or *kwleu for \\'turn\\', giving *kweklom or *kweklos, as in Greek kuklos. The Sanskrit word is chakra, but Sinhala has the form kæreke- for turn and karakave- for notions like rotation. Sinhala has not made \"k\" into \"ch\" . Sinhala also has the sound \"æ\" which is not present in any of the Indian languages regardless of family.  All this put together it is too pressing to ignore that Sinhala could have a different origin than from Sanskrit.

However, the lowest classes who live in the slums only speak one or two languages. I've spent some time in the slums, with middle-class Indian translators of course. Interestingly, while most slum neighborhoods could get by on a single language, neighbors in the big cities in the slums may speak completely different primary languages from each other, and some people couldn't communicate directly with each other without family members translating for them. The first thing my translators would have to do when meeting with a new family would be to establish what language(s) they could speak. Most of them could speak Kannada, Tamil, or Telugu, and could sometimes be identified ethnically or familially as such.\\n\\n\\nA final note about the English spoken there. While English has be influenced by American media, the English they learned is British, so they typically use British pronunciations with Indian accents (there is more than one). This is why it's often difficult for American ears to understand Indians speaking English. Indians can also speak English quite rapidly to each other, far more rapidly than most native English speakers anywhere else speak English.

Languages are generally open to learning by all in that community.Since Sanskrit is not open for all,it is not a language but a restricted private CODE only. Sanskrit is not allowed to be chanted by WOMEN and so it cannot qualify as MOTHER TONGUE.       Hence no one can declare Sanskrit as MOTHER TONGUE legitimately.  Language has to be SPOKEN to be a language; otherwise it’s a script only like JAVA etc.        Since Sanskrit was/is never spoken by a native community,it is deemed to be a coded script only.\\n\\nNow,with this background in mind,let’s examine whether Sanskrit is northern Tamil wearing the Sanskrit mask.We are all aware of the fact that Tamil is the language of the land mass India,spoken from time immemorial.It’s the language of the Indus Valley people of circa 3300 B.C. and dominated the entire Indian sub-continent from Balochistan to down south. Since Tamil was spoken pan India,regional variations and influences resulted in regional versions of Tamil.They were mostly corrupt forms of Tamil usage influenced by phonetic changes in Tamil words . The Sanskrit type phonetics penetrated into the northern version of spoken Tamil and made it look like Sanskrit. However,IE Etymologists who analysed Sanskrit words found out that the core,significant,base Sanskrit words are ultimately derived from Tamil roots only.E.g.The very word Samskrit itself is from Tamil root only.They also confirmed that Sanskrit words could not be originated in the absence of identified NATIVE SPEAKERS who can coin any original word in Sanskrit.\\n\\nLet’s examine a few core words in both the languages:\\n\\n———TAMIL——————SANSKRIT—————-COMMENTS\\n\\nSamam+Kirukkal——Sam+sKrit——————-Samskrit>SanskritVedam———————Ved—————————-Phonetic changeOkkham——————Yoga—————————Okkham>Oka>YogaPiriyal———————Priya—————————Priyam,Premam etc.Neekkal——————Nikaal————————-Phonetic change Kalam———————Kal——————————Phonetic change Vaa————————-Aaa(vo)————————Phonetic change Poa————————Jaoa——————————Phonetic change Kudil———————-Kutir—————————-Phonetic change many more In the circumstances,it’s safe to conclude that Tamil spoken with some phonetic and lexical twists in parts other than core Tamil Nadu has been tagged as Sanskrit in script form.', 'UgwxPdYGlRkOnUd3w_d4AaABAg': \"The northern part of Bengal has different language which is not Bengali ,it's kamtapuri.Because of Bengali influence now most of kamtapuri people speak Bengali or Bengali mixed kamtapuri.

Both languages were in close proximity, Avestan spoken in Eastern Iran(incl.Afg) and Vedic Sanskrit spoken in Northwest India. Prakrits/Middle Indo Aryan languages were widespread as with Modern Indo Aryan languages. By examining Buddhist, Jain and Hindu texts, scholars date Prakrits to 500 BC-500 AD.

Muhammad (pbuh) did not bring a new message, but conveyed the same message as previous prophets. \\n\\n(Part 2)\\nIslam spread by the sword? There people converted by the sword? Answer is absloutely no... lets see historical background\\n\\n((More than 80% non-Muslims in India))\\r\\nThe Muslims ruled India for about a thousand years. If they wanted, they hadthe power of converting each and every non-Muslim of India to Islam. Today more than 80% of the population of India are non-Muslims. All these non-Muslim Indians are bearing witness today that Islam was not spread by the sword.\\r\\n\\n\\n((14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians))\\r\\nMuslims were the lords of Arabia for 1400 years. For a few years the British ruled, and for a few years the French ruled. Overall, the Muslims ruled Arabia for 1400 years. Yet today, there are 14 million Arabs who are Coptic Christiansi.e. Christians since generations. If the Muslims had used the sword there wouldnot have been a single Arab who would have remained a Christian.\\n\\n((Indonesia and Malaysia))\\r\\nIndonesia is a country that has the maximum number of Muslims in the world.The majority of people in Malaysia are Muslims. May one ask, “Which Muslim army went to Indonesia and Malaysia?”\\r\\n\\r\\n((East Coast of Africa))\\r\\nSimilarly, Islam has spread rapidly on the East Coast of Africa. One may again ask, if Islam was spread by the sword, “Which Muslim army went to the East Coast of Africa?”\\r\\n\\nWith which sword was Islam spread? Even if Muslims had it they could not use it to spread Islam because the Qur’an says in the following verse:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from error”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Al-Qur’an 2:256]\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Sword of the Intellect\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the sword of intellect. The sword that conquers the hearts and minds of people. The Qur’an says in Surah Nahl, chapter 16 verse 125: “Invite (all) to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious.” [Al-Qur’an 16:125]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn article in Reader’s Digest ‘Almanac’, year book 1986, gave the statistics of the increase of percentage of the major religions of the world in half a century from 1934 to 1984. This article also appeared in ‘The Plain Truth’ magazine. At the top was Islam, which increased by 235 percent, while Christianity had increased only by a mere 47 percent. May one ask, which war took place in this century which converted millions of people to Islam?\\r\\n\\r\\n10-Islam is the fastest growing religion\\r\\n\\r\\nIslam is the fastest growing religion in America and Europe.

There is indeed strong linguistic pride but Indians had to communicate with each other in the past without Hindi or English, and they did so simply by learning the language they didn't know.\\nI am a native speaker of Tamil. Additionally I speak Hindi (learned it in school), English (also in school as it was the language of instruction), Gujarati (acquired from years of residence in Gujarat) and German. Let's leave German out, though, it's not relevant right now.\\nMy husband has spent altogether about 1.5 years in India and he only communicated with others in English. As he spent his time in big metropolitan cities, this was no problem. Of course, not everyone he encountered spoke English fluently, but enough to communicate at a basic level. I think he would agree with me when I say that English usually doesn't pose a problem in big cities, where Indians themselves use English as a bridge to communicate with different linguistic groups; however if my husband were to spend time in smaller cities or villages, he would absolutely have to develop at least basic competence in whichever language is spoken there. If he learns Hindi he's at home in the entire Hindi belt, however with only one Dravidian language he wouldn't be able to have a seamless experience in all of South India.\\nUnfortunately I can't speak for East India and what role English plays there in intergroup communication.\\n\\nThank you so much for your videos and I am so happy you made one about India!

The verbs and nouns used are very distinct in their dialectical base so much so that it's very difficult to even believe that it's the same language being spoken. Plus, the dialects have a different pronunciation variant so some phrases are sung , some swung, some yelled at. So, a verb used at the Western part of Maharashtra wouldn't be understood by those in the Eastern part of it. While speaking an extremely pure version of standardised Marathi in some pockets of places which emphasise on dialect would be seen challenging and insulting to their language, so whatever Marathi I've learnt through books (pure form of literature) can annoy a resin who speaks Varhadi dialect of Marathi and can assume that I'm trying insult him by speaking an extremely pure version. And that's hilarious.

In the era of Gupta emperors, the script of Eastern India and Western India started being distinct from each other, they got separated in 6th-7th century AD. Thereafter, Devanagari script was derived from the 'Siddha Matrika' script of Western India, and another distinct script of Eastern India gave birth to the Bengali script, that is the script of my mother tongue Bengali, also sometimes used in the Meitei language in Manipur state.\\n\\nThe ancestor script of Bengali script, i.e., the script of Eastern India, is found earliest in the archaeological evidence of copper-plate of King SamacharDeb in Kotalipara, present-day Bangladesh (previously part of Undivided India, before partition of 1947). Thereafter, this script was influenced by the Devanagari script to a few extent, but at the end of 10th century AD, this influence was eliminated, and the  ancestor of Bengali script having most close relation to its present form, was seen.

Then my native is Kannada, I stay in Bangalore. The actual facts we people studied in school was the linguistic census of 1991 that there are 826 Indian languages in India. About the Persian influence on North, I would like to tell Persians were several times Ruling India even before the Muslim Invasion. See Greek History about Xerxes in the battle of spartans. Xerxes ruled west India and derived income worth 200 Kg of gold everyday. Besides there is lot of evidence that the Mesopotomians and Sumerians did trade with the Harappan and Mohenjodaroens. The Durrani empire defeated the Marathas in the Battle of Panipat. Also, its not just because South India and North India was in close proximity for a long time that Sanskrit got added with Dravidian words, but there are two other factors: 1) An Empire called the Rashtrakutas ruled over vast area of North India from the place of its cities in the land of Kannada speakers, A king from Tamil community had made vast military expeditions all along the coast lines of greater India, into china extending far into south east Asia, and other Tamil kings have done seafare for vast times. 2) The languages that have perfect order of syllables and consonants to pronounce the vedic mantras exist only in Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Kashmiri. The rest of the languages or its speakers are incapable of pronouncing many letters of the vedic script as they simply dont exist in their native languages.  \\nSo speaking I use Hindi only when I am in Delhi, Mumbai or Kashmir. All the rest of the India, I speak English. I also know Russian, and I use it when I meet Russians in Parties. This apart, most of my distant family members learnt French or German. Only I took Russian. I saw in India, there is influence of French and Portuguese in Pondicherry and Goa states.  Rest of people learnt foreign language by Interest. My Father was born in Andhra state, he speaks Telugu although his native language is Kannada. My mother was born in Karnataka along the border of Andhra-she speaks Kannada and Telugu. Many of my distant relatives speak Tamil and Marathi. Also Dravidian languages of India cannot be confined to todays Republic of India-its there in Pakistan as Brahui and even in Nepal with many names. So speaking, the fastest growing language of any language in general and a Dravidian language in Particular is Tamil. However, the largest spoken Dravidian language in the world remain Brahui. This apart, Brahui shares greater similarity with Kannada as against the rest other three languages-Tamil, Telugu or Malayalam. However, Brahui doesnt have script so far. Inspite of this, it is believed that Brahui existed in the times of Harappa and other Indus valley civilizations with other neighbouring Dravidian languages.\\nAlso on mentioning branch of Sanskrit- there is no mention of Apabramshi.

You supported this by saying that Southern Indian languages do not borrow much as they are from a separate(ie Dravidian) language family. I understand the logic behind your argument, but here are some facts to disprove that argument.\\n\\n+There exists a South Indian language called Deccani or Dakkani which has 11 million native speakers, mostly Muslims in the Deccan region of India. This language is based off of Telugu, Kannada and to some extent Marathi and Tamil , akin to how Urdu is based off of the Khariboli dialect of Delhi, and borrows heavily from Arabic and Persian\\n+Your first point is true, that Muslim rule in India lasted longer in the north. This is the only reason that Hindi etc borrow from Persian. Being ruled for 900 years by Muslims, if the natives asserted their own culture or regional language, they would be prosecuted. So as a means to survive, many northeners were forced to imbibe in their daily speech Persian and Arabic words.\\n+It is only some words and phrases that are loaned from Persian and Arabic.

My mother understands Punjabi and also occasionally speaks it a bit, but she is more comfortable in Hindi. I grew up in Pune, which is considered to be the cultural center for Marathi. However, I am afraid to say, that though I have been exposed to so many different languages, the only Indian language that I can say that I confidently speak is Hindi/Hindustani (I want to learn the Perso-Arabic script for Urdu!) Because my father is a native Odia speaker, his Hindi is not ideal (he makes some grammatical mistakes) so the language that I grew up speaking at home the most is English. I speak some Hindi with my mother, but for the most part, I use English with my friends. I grew up in a very Anglophone environment and attended a school which dates back to British colonial rule, and emphasized the English language above all else.

Modern Sanskrit is NOT the mother language of the north Indian language, although that is a very popular concept. There was a pre-Sanskrit language form widely used in northern india, the \"Ardhamagadhi Prakrit\" (prakrit basically meaning common) which was codified and modernized by the scholars (mainly Panini). The classical/Vedic sanskrit on the other hand could be the fountain from which prakrit and even later the sanskrit that we see today was developed. It is also of a lot of debate whether the vedic sanskrit was even known as sanskrit. The vedic people never said anywhere that they wrote or spoke in sanskrit language. Significant amount of modernization and codification happened around the time of Panini,  a couple of centuries BCE. The resulting modern language became the language of the scholars and the texts. Almost all the sanskrit plays would have all the educated people speaking in sanskrit and the women and poor people speaking in prakrit. Prakrit still remained the main spoken language and sanskrit was only used by, as mentioned earlier, the scholars. Prakrit independently evolved all over india and some of them underwent modernization at a later date and some didn\\'t. bengali for example was modernized by people like Ishwarchandra Bidyasagar, and therefore bengali is a modern language (with lots of words taken from Sanskrit). Many other languages were not formally modernized (eg Odiya) and are therefore known as classical languages.\\nIn fact, your flow chart should have read, Indo-european root language-->Vedic language-->Prakrit--> Sanskrit and others\\n\\nAnother point, Sinhala (language from SriLanka) is not western Prakrit (Maharashtri) as shown, it\\'s eastern prakrit (Magadhi), as the culture of the island was heavily influenced by the conquests of Prince Bijaysingha (Vijaya) who was from the areas around modern day bengal.\\n\\n\\nI natively speak Bangla, can also speak well in Hindi and english, can reasonably understand (among the major languages) Assamese, Odiya, Nepali, Punjabi, Gujarati and Marathi.

But South Asianists often seem to assume that it is the other way around, that the dialects are “derived from Sanskrit,” because Sanskrit won the race to the archives and was the first to be written down and preserved, and we only encounter vernaculars much later. So we say that Sanskrit is older, and the vernaculars younger. But Sanskrit, the language of power, emerged in India from a minority, and at first its power came precisely from its nonintelligibility and unavailability, which made it the power of an elite group. Walt Kelly’s Pogo used to use the word “Sam-skrimps” to describe highfalutin double-talk or manipulative twaddle. Many Euro-Americans mispronounce it “Sanscript,” implying that it is a language without (sans) an (intelligible) script, or “Sand-script,” with overtones of ruined cities in the desert or a lost language written in sand.\"', 'UgyI3yK_Ij954ZuNZu54AaABAg.8rqR4OPcjPP8rqU2ODimyK': 'some good discussions from Quora\\n\"Sanskrit cant be older than Prakrit. Language existed before civilization even when human kind was a tribal. And Sanskrit is civilized language and Language comes first then grammar. Initially language will be in primitive format, and it evolves as communication language over the period without awareness of grammar. Sanskrit logically perfect, means sanskrit is refined out of existing language. That mean already prakrit existed before sanskrit came. Sanskrit evolved on the book. So physical proof wise sanskrit looks older, but spoken language wise definitely Prakrit is older. Sanskrit is a refined form of existing language. Refined in many way,  by creating sentence applying grammar(panini created this grammar, considered as first linguistic born on earth), by polishing words to sound good,  by creating words by joining existing words with rules etc. So it is called refined language(sanskrit) and natural language is called prakrit. But later people started to bring content available in the sanskrit to spoken language of people. In that proccess lot of words which are originally of spoken language but polished came back to spoken language. It is like dophin. Animals on the earth came from sea, but later those animal went back to sea and in that process it evolved to dolphin, whales etc. Spoken prakrit also started to evolve on the book and on people tongue both and turned to many language like marathi, bengali, hindi etc. In south there were different family languages which existed before sanskrit. Even those language started to get influenced by sanskrit. But tamil kept it self distant from such influence. So it is  less influenced and it has more non sanskrit vocabulary comparing to sanskrit vocabulary in it. Even if you study tribal language of india you cant find any sanskrit words in it.

We can deduce this by following sound changes, which are generally very regular over time. There are some Sanskrit words with certain sounds that seem to haphazardly correlate to different sounds in their cognate Prakrit words indicating that they did not directly descend from Sanskrit. \\n\\n\\nThe Bengali-Assamese script did not come from Devanagari. Both came from a common medieval Nagari script that ultimately descends from the Gupta script whose ancestor was Brahmi. The current forms of most major Indian writing systems came about in the late-18th and 19th centuries with the adoption of the printing press (which was a difficult task because of the complex nature of Indic scripts). At this time, many writing systems fell out of common use around this time as well, especially by the 20th century. For example, Marathi used to be written in the Modi script, Maithili in Mithilakshar, Bhojpuri in Kaithi, Nepali in Bhujimol or Prachalit Nepali but they all commonly use Devanagari today, except for ceremonial purposes. \\n\\n\\nWestern Pahari languages like Dogri that border the Punjabi speaking area are also tonal. Some eastern dialects of Bengali are also marginally tonal.\\n\\n\\nThe most glaringly obvious Dravidian influence on the Indo-Aryan languages are the retroflex consonants. In Vedic Sanskrit, they are marginal phonemes, occurring rather rarely and only in certain environments. By the Classical Sanskrit era, they are all over the place with the influx of many Dravidian words. Another Dravidian feature in some IA languages like Gujarati and Marathi is the distinction between inclusive and excluse \"we\". The speaker can make the distinction between including or excluding the listener when he or she says \"we\". \\n\\n\\nThe Indo-Aryan languages are a great example showing how identity and politics have shaped the view of what is a language or dialect. The Bihari languages like Bhojpuri, Maithili, Angika, Magahi, etc, for example, descent from the Magadhi Prakrit (as do Bengali, Assamese, and Oriya) and not the Sauraseni Prakrit (like Hindi), but speakers often view themselves as speaking \"dialects of Hindi\".  These languages had strong literary traditions of their own but during the late Mughal and British Raj eras, Hindi-Urdu was used as the language of schooling and administration and the census designated these languages as Hindi. Similarly, the Rajasthani languages, though they come from the Sauraseni Prakrit as does Hindi and Punjabi, are more closely related to Gujarati but are still thought of as Hindi dialects today.', 'Ugx_932j6YY_vl6xMo94AaABAg.8rpuwkKiBqv8rpw-GC3Ijz': 'Regarding your first point, I’m aware of the distinction, but there are two ways to look at it. Did they descend from the codified standard form of Classical Sanskrit that was used in literature? Not exactly. But did they descend from the closely related dialects that  gave rise to the standardized form? I think the answer to that is yes, and it’s the same with Latin developing into various Romance dialects, and it’s the same for Old Church Slavonic, etc. No standardized language is really naturally occurring, but rather constructed from a set of dialects. So whenever we say that modern languages developed from an older language, it’s never really the written form that we know, it’s the dialects, plus additional influence from the standard language.', 'UgwU5hmFrHN0KbQoZi54AaABAg': 'Which language is \"bitch lasagna\" from?', 'UgwpM005Fz92PeUJkyt4AaABAg': 'Great video man!', 'Ugx_Pz6xApZmlYZQd854AaABAg': \"I speak Gujarati, Hindi, and English.

According to linguists, Kannada branched off simultaneously from the Proto-Tamil branch of South Dravidian-1 division before the Christian Era.\\r\\nTelugu Writing is highly influenced by Kannada writing system except some letters. The Telugu script is derived from that of the 6th-century Chalukya dynasty and is related to that of the Kannada language.\\r\\nKannada language next to Telugu language has many words ending in vowels which many consider a mellifluous quality and thus suitable for musical expression. So most songs (Kirtanas) are in Kannada and Telugu, specifically !\\r\\nThe grammar of the Kannada language is very complex and is quite different from the grammar of other Indian languages. For starters, every single noun in Kannada has a gender, of which there are three (feminine, masculine, and neutral). This isn’t necessarily out of the ordinary, but the fact that natural gender and grammatical gender are one and the same changes things. In other words, if the word for “sun” is masculine, then the sun is masculine in other contexts as well.\\r\\nThe word order is subject–object–verb, as in the other Dravidian languages. Verbs are marked for person, number, and gender. The case-marking pattern is nominative-accusative, with experiencer subjects taking the dative inflection. Most inflection is rendered through affixation, especially of suffixes. The language uses typical Dravidian retroflex consonants (sounds pronounced with the tip of the tongue curled back against the roof of the mouth), such as /ḍ/, /ṇ/, and /ṭ/, as well as a series of voiced and voiceless aspirates borrowed from the Indo-Aryan language family.\\r\\nThe script used to write Kannada has the same name as the language and includes 49 letters divided up into 3 different groups. Though spoken Kannada varies from region to region, and approximately 20 different dialects of the language do exist, written Kannada tends not to vary from one community to the next.  ಜೈ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ,\\xa0ಜೈ\\xa0ಕನ್ನಡ', 'Ugzvqcd_RCAALPpPQCd4AaABAg.8rojLsWa81d8s53H1qUeMs': '@Satez woww thanks mate... ಜೈ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ ಮಾತೆ', 'Ugzvqcd_RCAALPpPQCd4AaABAg.8rojLsWa81d8s2PVx4b5FB': 'A German national wrote the first ever Malayalam-English dictionary.

(The politics surrounding what language should be spoken/taught in schools is a completely different discussion or rather a video)\\n- There's always an element of pride when it comes to refusing to learn a different language; and part of the reason is also due to many years of how Hindi was being pushed and shoved into the Southern and Noth-Eastern parts of India forcing the people to abandon their native tongues that are over 2-3 millenia old.

For this the indigenous dialects (usually Awadhi or Braj Bhasha) are nearly always employed by Hindus. Urdu on the other hand, having had a natural growth, has a vigorous poetical literature.

Well, \"pretty well\", I\\'d say - and, as always, the farther away from \"civilisation\" you move, the more difficult it becomes - as rural folks tend to speak very limited English (to the point of almost none).\\nHowever, and this is rather significant, I think - being a native English speaker is a great DISadvantage, as you always expect, subconsciously, certain forms of speach, certain phrases and words (a.k.a. \"proper English\") - which rarely is the case. Most Indians speak somewhat \"localised\" or even creole English, a.k.a. \"Hinglish\" (same case as it is in Singapore with Singlish). They often drop in hindi words, like \"lakh\" or \"crore\" (100 thousand / 10 million), or \"lahti\" (long bamboo stick used as a weapon, typically by police - something like \"truncheon\" before being \"truncated\", so to speak), or \"-walla\" suffix, \"matter-of-factly\" expecting you to just know them.\\n\\nOn the other hand, being a non-native English speaker (while being a native speaker of some other Indo-European language) does help, as your mind is kind of more flexible when it comes to interpretation of somewhat incorrect phrases or decoding the intended meaning of \"wrong\" noun or verb. For instance, a reply \"sandwich no possible\" (at roadside cafeteria) may leave native English speaker baffled, while non-native English speaker will typically \"decode\" it easilly as \"I\\'m sorry, sandwiches are not available\". Or, \"honee pancake, can or not?\" (Ditto for understanding native English by locals.)\\nAlso, a rather specific way of pronunciation of the local variety of English (kinda \"hard\", something akin to Russian or Polish pronunciation) make it easier to understand it by Slavic language speakers (I\\'m a Polish native speaker myself).\\nThere were more than few instances where I, or my friends, with still then limited command of English, acted as an interpreter between locals and native (UK or Australian) English speakers - which may sound funny and counterintuitive, but it is true.\\nMy Australian pal had some difficulty in \"adjusting\" to local English at first, but when he eventually learned \"how to speak proper Hinglish\" he then always got scorns from his mother whenenever he visited her in Australia - she, being a university teacher of English philology, always greeted him with \"what is the language you are speaking?\" sneer... : )\\nIt seems to me that this issue (expecting certain sounds and phrases by native speakers, thus hindering understanding of \"another variety\" of given language) is quite common problem - I happened to witness this very Austarlian guy talking once to UK born woman. I could sense some tension, or uneassines, in the conversation, and while I didn\\'t know what was the reason I had absolutelly no problem understanding anything any of them said. So I was quite suprised when my friend said to me afterwards, with some exasperation, \"I couldn\\'t understand a bloody word she was saying\". Which was obviously an exaggeration, but still shows the issue.\\nAlso, at some other time and place, I happened to act as interpreter for certain Thai lady (a member of airport staff) and certain Bangladeshi gentlemen (a passenger), who both spoke good English, yet seemed to be totally unable to understand each other - but that\\'s another story, for another night, as Scheherazade used to end her tales... : )', 'UgwsOUSpiyRiC3neZVh4AaABAg.8rnGBUQ9Bzh8s-IPo3iFRO': '@MrKotBonifacy , I can understand your point , I met a French tourist my French terrorised him yet he felt my English is a bit fast for him to catch (then I understand my native language influence on my non native language communication skills )', 'UgwsOUSpiyRiC3neZVh4AaABAg.8rnGBUQ9Bzh8rrq1SOAkQ1': '@h:kena \\n\\nJust a clarification on my earlier observation \"Most Indians speak somewhat \"localised\" or even creole English, a.k.a. \"Hinglish\" - which, I guess, prompted you to make that remark:\\xa0\\n\"I wouldn\\'t say most Indians speak that damned creole known as Hinglish... Many urban folk who try to sound \"educated\" or went to English-medium schools do speak Hinglish, but many rural people do not, especially educated rural people.\"\\n\\nFirstly, my observation reflected my experience with that strata od Indian society I happened to interact with - I did not work in some high-tech business or in some university, most of my contact was with \"common folks\" - shopkeepers, tourist agents, all kind of various \"vallahs\", hotels\\' and hostels\\' staff, waiters at roadside cafeterias, taxi and riksha drivers, immigration and customs officials - and so on. Also, it wasn\\'t meant to denigrate Indians and their \"variety of English\" - I take it as something perfectly normal, that \"borrowed\" languages always gets \"localised\".\\nThere was a series \"on English\", in 2001, on BBC Radio (BBC 4?), named \"Routes of English - The History of Spoken English Around the World\" - and AFAIR one part of it was \"Whose English is It Anyway\",  specifically devoted to \"various varieties and flavours of English around the world\".\\n\\nSecondly, in my previous statement the main point was that MOST Indians speak SOMEWHAT (i.e. to a certain degree) localised English, and then there are some who even speak a creole variety of it.\\nLike in this sentence: \"Eh, Baba (or \"Payjee\"), you coming Singapore next week or no coming\"? (verbatim quote - question asked by some Punjabi fellow, a merchant, residing in Delhi). Or \"where were you?\" - instead of \"where have you been\" - and other \"no possible\" sandwiches, and many others Ican\\'t recall right now.\\n\\nAnd yes - I should have put that \"Hinglish\" next to \"localised\", or maybe put that \"or even creole\" in brackets - my fault, being a native speaker of Slavic language I sometimes don\\'t pay enough attention to a proper word order. You see, Slavic languages are highly inflective (three noun genders for singular, two genders for plural form, times six grammary cases, times two declensions - \"strong\" and \"weak\", plus some irregularities - yes, this is confusing, I know... : ) - and the result is  you can scramble virtually any sentence any way you like, and its meaning (and its \"customary word order\") could still be deduced by a native speaker (in most cases, at least). And that, on the other hand, leads to rather relaxed approach to word order in a senstence - and when I\\'m in hurry, tired, or just concentrate intensely on the topic itself (as opposed to \"writting\" or \"speech\" themselves) that language pattern slips through.\\n\\nI hope it clarifies the matter.\\nCheers, KB', 'UgwUDBvT6pI_cq8zTqh4AaABAg': 'I love Indian languages as well as the BEAUTIFUL Brahmic scripts.', 'Ugw1d7Eyt_iC4b2rkOh4AaABAg': \"Don't get Ol Chiki with me Paul !\", 'Ugy6Fenc5szGOuk3Xld4AaABAg': 'Garo is speake in meghalaya also known A.chik', 'UgxRo_w6mTD8GSfZ6Wp4AaABAg': 'from northeast', 'Ugzc7WMceVgCQxd7Lu54AaABAg': \"I am an Indian born in Canada and I can speak, read, and write English, Hindi, and Awadhi (a language from eastern UP that's closely related to Hindi).

My experience was that middle/upper class and educated people tend to speak English, as did people who come into contact with lots of tourists and foreigners, so I was generally able to use English with them, but I was also able to use my limited Hindi to talk to people who did not know enough English to communicate. I also spent time in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, but only picked up a few phrases in Malayalam and Tamil (I would have liked to have learned more, but time and exposure were big factors). Even so, people were very appreciative of the effort when I was able to say something to them in Malayalam or Tamil. Many people in those two states spoke English as well, so overall I didn't have much trouble getting around. So I would say that, if you're spending time in big cities or touristy spots, you'll have no problem using English, but if you put in some effort to learn Hindi or one of the other scheduled languages, you'll be able to communicate with more people and they'll really appreciate it when you do.\", 'Ugw3uDx4nr4VORkXodx4AaABAg': 'How did so many scripts develope in India?', 'UgzsmpQY4QVnhjYfyJ94AaABAg': 'now do a languages of Papua New Guinea.', 'UgzsmpQY4QVnhjYfyJ94AaABAg.8rnA6rEoFkV8ro7RRWfYWI': 'ok', 'UgzsmpQY4QVnhjYfyJ94AaABAg.8rnA6rEoFkV8rn_z_HmXBh': 'Why?

There is a large migrant population in India who travel away from their homes and therefore often learn a third language as a necessity. \\n\\nThe Dravidian languages are quite distinct from the Indo-Aryan languages especially in the use of certain sounds like ɭ and ɻ.\\n\\nI would also like to point out that there is a significant influence in each of our languages from the European Colonizer languages (and vice versa) as well, such as English and Portuguese.\\n\\nMost of the school curricula in non-Hindi speaking belt would have three languages as part of the coursework, if not two.

(This was not the case during the British Colonial period, and this reorganisation occurred after Independence. For instance, the modern state of Karnataka has areas that  were under Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency as well as the Hyderabad Pricely State of Nizam.)\\n\\nI appreciate this video for its effort to restrain from generalizations.', 'UgxuMlSkaZ_9XFmyfFx4AaABAg': \"My native language in Hindi/Urdu and Bangla.

For example, when you say ਘਰ vs ਕਰ੍ਹ, the tones of the words are quite different. Another example of this is (these aren\\'t necessarily real words) how differently you\\'d pronounce ਭਾਈ and ਬਾਈ. \\n\\nI also put \"aspirated\" in quotes because in truth these consonant sounds are not really aspirated anymore in modern Punjabi as the falling tone has slowly replaced it in speech. But we still call them aspirated for whatever reason and transliterate them as such in English by putting an \"h\" after the initial consonant sound (eg. ਭ = bh), which just leads to more confusion for learners but that\\'s a story for another day.\\n\\nSometimes the presence of ਹ is used to show tone as well, even when it\\'s not fully pronounced (though this makes the vowel have a rising tone rather than a falling tone). For example ਚਾਹ, when properly pronounced, should have a slight rising tone. However many native speakers aren\\'t aware that they do this automatically (and some may not even do it) so how prevalent this phenomenon is might be a bit uncertain. \\n\\nThat said, in terms of it being a tonal language to the extent that let\\'s say, Mandarin or Cantonese is, it\\'s definitely not *as* hardcore or uses tones to distinguish meaning in the same way lol.\\n\\nsource: i studied Punjabi for a few years in uni and also wikipedia', 'UgzRJKZkONGq-6x-ZGB4AaABAg.8rmd42j4cMU8rpvlrU12kW': '@Shantanu Upadhyay It is a good example, but poorly explained.

In 1965 it led to anti-Hindi agitation, spear-headed by Tamil speakers. The Central government (of India) relented & doled out some concessions. Lately, it came to be known as a badge of patriotism to know Hindi. Hindi as a Sanskrit 'Apabhramsa', is a late comer unlike some ancient languages (mostly the Dravidian languages) in India, who feel that their language is superior in vocabulary, etymology & scientific terms. The crucial factor is that Hindi drifted away from its Sanskrit 'Phonetic' content during the long Muslim rule & became synonymous with Urdu. Both are same but differ drastically in their scripts.
